# STAT 601 ‚Äì Time Series Analysis Problem Set 3 (R Markdown)

This repository contains my third project for **STAT 601: Time Series Analysis** at **South Dakota State University**.  
It was completed in **R Markdown**, integrating statistical analysis, forecasting models, and time series visualizations using the **fpp3** framework.

## üìò Project Overview
This problem set builds upon the first two assignments and demonstrates advanced applications of time series modeling and decomposition techniques in R.

### Key Sections:
1. **Time Series Decomposition**
   - Seasonal, trend, and remainder analysis using `STL()` and `X11()`.
   - Comparison of additive and multiplicative components.

2. **Modeling and Forecasting**
   - Implementation of **ARIMA** and **ETS** models.
   - Forecast comparison using accuracy measures (RMSE, MAE, MAPE).

3. **Residual Analysis**
   - Checking for autocorrelation and white noise.
   - Evaluating model fit with `gg_tsresiduals()` and `ACF()` plots.

4. **Interpretation**
   - Discussion of key insights from plots and model outputs.
   - Explanation of how each method performs across datasets.
